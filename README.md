### ideation 

Lots of brainstorming. I knew I wanted something cozy but spooky since my current game leans very eery. 
I thought it would be cool if you played as like an entity from the conjuring/paranormal activity. 
I originally thought a fps view with like looping cards for potential haunts could be a mood. 
I like the idea of getting packs with specific haunts, I'm fond of having to deterimine haunt order before hand and playing around that. 
Think like neon white meets phasmo where you are the ghost. 
real time ai seemed like too much to chew with really limited tiem to work on the jam. 

Pivot -> Top down turn based spooky huanted house manager where all the hauntings are determined loop of cards. 

This felt a little boring if it was solely picking an order of cards, so added another dimension in that "spooky events" and locations are two seperate cards pieces that combine to form one card.
So you'll be able to directly build 3 aspects of the haunts with the loop (event, location, time).
AI that reacts to this on a turn based basis will enable players to progress tactically (player will learn to predict how ai will respond to a haunt and tries to create a loop that keeps scaring them as much as possible).

Could have cool chaining player generated loops > ai person in bedroom gets spooked by hallway door shaking (event 1), goes to bathroom to hide hide between haunts, lights flicker in bathroom spooking them (event 2) -> items get thrown in bathroom (event 3)-> ai leaves room between haunts -> loop restarts 
could have cool multiplayers for spooking multiple people at once

progression system of quantified fear to buy more cards via packs
progressino system to upgrade house via money spent by people visiting the haunted house

### defined goals

Looping system with cards constructed of events and location
Working ai that reacts in very basic manner to haunts. 
Some sort of visuals for rooms and haunted house guests. 
Some sort of visuals for haunts
Some sort of visuals for card creation and loop construction

### what actually got done

data structures and some classes for loops and triggering events.
